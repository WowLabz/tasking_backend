### **Overview** ðŸ“„

Dot Marketplace is a general purpose decentralised marketplace created as a Substrate pallet.  

The current scope of work involves two user types: **Customer** and **Service Provider (or Worker)**

- The Customer can post a task and invite bids from Service Providers to fulfill it. 
- The Customer needs to deposit the budgeted amount in an escrow for the task to be published. 
- The Service Provider needs to deposit some token to participate in a bid. If not shortlisted, this bid amount is returned. 
- The Service Provider completes the task and submits it. 
- The Customer accepts the work and the escrowed amount is credited to the Service Providers wallet.
- The Customer rates the Service Provider and visa versa 

NOTE: If the Customer doesn't accept the work, a dispute is raised and it gets resolved in a decentralised court (out of current scope) which will be implemented in the next phase. 

The following diagrams highlight the workflow:

Dot Marketplace is being built as a Substrate pallet. It would include boilerplate code that parachain teams can customize as per their own requirements. We believe this project has the potential to transform community participation, engagement and governance in decentralized projects.

The current focus is to enhance the existing Substrate pallet and allied code base to get a basic yet functional marketplace up and running:


### **Ecosystem Fit**

Dot Marketplace can be used by any decentralised project to float tasks and invite their community members to execute them for a reward. Its MVP was developed during the Polkadot India buildathon (2021).  

The inspiration for Dot Marketplace emerged from our own needs while building Yoda - a protocol that facilitates decentralised app development leveraging open data. Dot Marketplace would be used to create data, services and app marketplaces on Yoda, which would motivate us to maintain this project in the long run.

### **Team&#39;s experience**

Dot Marketplace is being built by the team at Wow Labz.
Wow Labz is one of India&#39;s leading turnkey product development companies.
Yoda Protocol has been conceptualised and is being built by the team at Wow Labz. The team has previously built a decentralised storage protocol called Lake Network - [https://lakenetwork.io/](https://lakenetwork.io/) in addition to multiple dApps on Ethereum, Stellar, EOS and Hyperledger.

## **Development Roadmap**ðŸ”©

The development of Dot Marketplace is already underway. 
For the custom pallet (tasking) we have: 
1. Used various Substrate provided traits like - `Currency`, `ExistenceRequirement`, `LockIdentifier`, `LockableCurrency`, `ReservableCurrency` and few more;
2. Used the pre-existing pallets like `assets`, `balances` and `staking`;
3. Implemented custom structs like `Task Details` and `Transfer Details`. These in return are used for various functionalities like `publish task`, `bid for task`, `complete task` and `approve task`. A special transfer money function is only initiated once the task cycle gets completed and the escrow funds are released to the worker. 

All the below mentioned Milestones are going to be an RFP response and this application is going to be fully public.
  
NOTE: A barebones UI would also be provided as a part of this submission to help the developer experience the functionality

### **Milestone 1**

The main deliverable for this milestone will be to allow a user to register via a registration form and link her Polkawallet account along with role based switching from Service Provider view to Customer view and visa versa.


| Number        | Deliverable   | Specification  |
| :-------------|:-------------:| :--------------|
| 1      | [Documentation](https://github.com/WowLabz/tasking_backend) | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a tutorial that explains how a user can use DOT Marketplace and understand the flow of tasking pallet.         |
| 2      | User Registration | Form based user registration         |
| 3      | Wallet Linking | Support for user to link their Polkawallet with the account.     |
| 4      | Profile | Support for role based screens to ease the usability for users  |
| 5      | Containerisation | Docker image creation of the first milestone along with a script to run unit tests | 
| 6      | Documentation | Documentation of code including a document to build the code from source | 

### **Milestone 2**

In continuation to the previous work, we will be working on a rating system for both Customer and Service Provider. This rating will eventually be the motivating factor for performance in the network to be incentivized for quality work. :


| Number        | Deliverable   | Specification  |
| :-------------|:-------------:| :--------------|
| 1      | User Rating Workflows | Support for profile based rating using substrate balances, treasury and staking pallets to be integrated with our custom tasking pallet to weigh the user's performance and rewards based rating system.          |
| 2      | Programmatic Wallet Transfer | Substrate based Smart Contract transfer function for programmatic/automated transfer of tokens from one application/user to the other.         |
| 3      | Asset Restrictions | Support for the locking of assets by time         |
| 4      | Containerisation | Docker image creation of the second milestone along with a script to run unit tests | 

  
### **Milestone 3**
The deliverable for this milestone is that we will be providing a multi user scenario to test the functionality and integrate with storage and backend APIs for multipart data to be uploaded and downloaded.

| Number        | Deliverable   | Specification  |
| :-------------|:-------------:| :--------------|
| 1      | Scalability | Support for multiple Substrate seed users to test the functionality and make the task based transactions as per the Status mentioned. Substrate based Lockable currency for reserving user funds and allowing the escrow unlock after the approved status.         |
| 2      | Profile Tagging | Support for smart tags with the user profiles for programmatic track/domain alignment in the future        |
| 3      | Document Upload  | API connections to cloud storage async upload/download of small files via Rocket      |
| 4      | Testing | Repositories including the deployment and test sections for instructions and scripts to help contributors to package, deploy, run and test.       |
| 5      | Documentation | Documentation of the entire pallet, a guide for developers forking the project including FAQ | 
| 6      | Containerisation | Docker image creation of the entire package  |
