Court Summons:
1. If a customer feels that the task is not upto the mark - Summon the court in provide worker rating

Case A: Worker wins 
Worker gets back their money from escrow 
Worker gets the money for the task 

2. If a worker feels the rating provided is unsatisfactory - Summon the court in provide customer rating
3. If a customer feels the rating provided is unsatisfactory - Sumon the court in a new function

-> Ratings is provided more importance than tokens because ratings affect other oppotunities as well in the long terms
For increase in rating -> (% above mjority * 0.5) + actual rating received
No deductions in rating for the osing side as of now

If a customer gets unjust ratings from the worker:
1. Chances of becoming a juror is affected
2. Chances of geeting workers for future tasks is affected

If a worker gets unjust ratings from the customer:
1. Chances of becoming a juror is affected
2. Chances fo getting picked for future tasks is affected


Points of contention:
1. How to affect the ratings in Court Summons 2&3
2. How to affect/access balances when the whole transaction involves more tokens than what is present in the escrow
3. How to make sure jurors are domian experts/capable 

Escrow should be released once customer ratings has been provided by the worker

Primary Escrow  - Price  + Bid for task - Released after provide customer ratings
Secondary Escrow  - Court fee from publisher + Court fee from worker - Released after customer accepts provided rating
