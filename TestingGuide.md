## Setup ##
First, complete the basic Rust setup instructions. If you want to play at the code level.

If No, then plz follow this simple guide to make your life easy :)

Run in Docker

# Install Docker & Docker-Compose

First, install Docker and Docker Compose. Follow the basic installation guide [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

For a Windows Machine

[Follow the guide mentioned here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

Installation from the terminal on a Ubuntu/Linux Machine 

`curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

# Docker quick guide

To check the compose version
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
To run the build

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
``` 

To stop the service

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To view the installed images locally

```bash
docker images
```

To delete the images

```bash
docker rmi <IMAGE ID>
```

To get more idea about the project and the build please refer the link [Project Brief](https://github.com/WowLabz/tasking_backend#readme)

# Guide To Run All The Services At Once

Clone the repo [Dot_Marketplace_Docker](https://github.com/WowLabz/dot_marketplace_docker.git)

Once this repo is cloned, follow the commands below to start all the services at once from the main project directory

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
You will be able to see all the running services using 
```bash
docker ps
```
Each of these services will be running on the local system ports as below
1. dot_marketplace_frontend: Directly run the frontend to test out the application. [http://127.0.0.1:9001]
2. authentication_service: This is the api server to check the authentication service [http://127.0.0.1:7001]
3. marketplace_mongo: Mongodb for the application
4. dot_marketplace_node: Substrate based blockchain node, this can also be tested on the [polkadot js explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/) Select local node to connect to the local running chain.[ws://127.0.0.1:9944]

To stop all the services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

# Guide To Run Each Of The Services Individually

Names of the individual service files
1. Blockchain Node: `tasking_backend.docker-compose.yml`
2. UI: `tasking_frontend.docker-compose.yml`
3. Auth Server: `authentication_service.docker-compose.yml`
4. Mongodb: `marketplace_mongo.docker-compose.yml`

To run the services individually 

```bash
docker-compose -f <file_name> up --build -d
```
To stop an individual service

```bash
docker-compose -f <file_name> down
```

3. [Authentication Service](https://github.com/WowLabz/authentication_service.git)

# Container Instructions
In order to check for the status of the running node run 
```bash
docker-compose logs <CONTAINER ID>
```

# Run UI
You can access the frontend application on `http://127.0.0.1:9001`

# Launch Interactive Bash Session with the Node
    
```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
``` 
|OR| 
```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/sh
```
    
# Run Tests for the blockchain node

Enter into the interactive bash with the container id pertaining to dot_marketplace_node and run the following commands
    
`cargo test` (This will run all the test cases)
 
 `cargo test <test_name>` (For checking any specific test case)
